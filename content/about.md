Hi, we're Sturdy and [Al](https://twitter.com/alanbush), and we make up stories about people and how they get along with each other.

We perform in San Antonio, Texas, mostly at [Studio 185](https://www.google.com/maps/place/ComedySportz+San+Antonio/@29.4980086,-98.7146113,11z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sstudio+185+san+antonio!3m4!1s0x865c68860bf3ce87:0x6a8fc18bbee1a15!8m2!3d29.5494323!4d-98.4628109). Come out and see a show sometime.

## Alan

You can call me Al. I've been performing improv for a lot longer than I'd like to admit, starting with a high school league in Kansas City, and running almost continually through the present, most recently at [ComedySportz San Antonio](https://www.cszsa.com/), and right here, with Something Neutral.

## Sturdy

He's done some improv, and is pretty good at it. Until he sends me his bio, though, this is all he gets.
