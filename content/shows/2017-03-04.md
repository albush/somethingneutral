Description = "Your Saturday night plans are covered! Come out and laugh with Something Neutral, [SuckerPunch](https://www.facebook.com/SPSATX/), and [Bruce Banner](https://www.facebook.com/brucebannerimprov/). We've had a chance to perform with each of these groups individually - but never both on the same night. We're excited to see if Studio 185 can hold us. Bring your beverages and your weirdo suggestions and let's see what happens."
